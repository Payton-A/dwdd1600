        <h1>MLB history</h1>

        
        <h2>Baseball Orginates</h2>

        <p>Baseball's origins can be traced back to various bat-and-ball games played in England, such as stoolball and rounders. These games were brought to North America by English colonists in the 18th century and shared similarities with the modern game of baseball. </p>

        <p> In the early 19th century, variations of these games were played on both sides of the Atlantic under names like "town ball", "round ball", and "base-ball". Modern baseball rules were significantly shaped by Wikipediaamateur clubs in New York City in the mid-19th century nicknamed the "New York style".</p>
